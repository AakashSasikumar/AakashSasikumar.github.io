First of all, you might ask why this website is called GSAK. Those letters are the initials of my awkwardly long name Guruvayoor Sasikumar Aakash Krishna.

I am Aakash, a 21 year old undergrad Computer Science student from Coimbatore, India. I have traveled to a lot of places , done my schooling from 9 schools across the world and what I have procured from it, is my passion for coding. It all started when I got my first laptop at the age of nine and made my first website when I was 11 years old. What inspired me the most at the first place is the potential computer science has. To appease my curiosity, I strive to know how things work; I am determined to innovate something in this field.
