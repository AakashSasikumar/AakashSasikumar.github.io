  to: Present
  points:
    - Helped develop a novel RL-based algorithm for reducing cost of training building Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system control policies
    - Our algorithm reduces energy consumption by up to 30\% depending on the building
    - Used Weights and Biases to track and visualize experiments
    - Published our work in peer-reviewed journals and conferences

  to: Aug 2021
  points:
    - Built an Electric Vehicle (EV) user behavior and traffic simulator for the city of Luxembourg
    - Developed dynamic pricing strategies to manage EV charging demand and supply
    - Developed a "Supply Uberization" solution, and published our work in ACM e-Energy `20
    - Developed and implemented Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms for dynamic pricing
    - Published the work on dynamic pricing with RL to IEEE Intelligent Transportation System Magazine

- title: Research Intern, TCS Research and Innovation
  from: Jan 2019
  to: Jun 2019
  points:
    - Worked on Cyber Physical Modelling for solar PhotoVoltaic (PV) cells
    - Built a test suite for for analyzing behavior of large scale solar PVs, e.g., solar farms
    - This test suite helped generate data to validate existing, and develop new fault detection and classification algorithms

- title: Intern, Thermo Fisher Scientific
  from: May 2018
  to: Jul 2018
  points:
    - Responsible for building an automation solution for the Thermo Scientific Spinnaker robotic arm
    - Built a custom dataset and trained a CNN based object detector to help it identify specific locations on different Thermo Scientific instruments
    - This robot removes the need for saving these locations manually and automates the entire process for transporting hazardous chemicals from/to various biomedical instruments
    - Optimized the deep learning model to run on a low-power embedded system
