- title: Research Intern, TCS Research and Innovation
  from: Jan 2019
  to: Jun 2019
  points:
    - Worked on Cyber Physical Modelling for solar PhotoVoltaic (PV) cells
    - Built a test suite for for analyzing behavior of large scale solar PVs, e.g., solar farms
    - This test suite helped generate data to validate existing, and develop new fault detection and classification algorithms

- title: Intern, Thermo Fisher Scientific
  from: May 2018
  to: Jul 2018
  points:
    - Responsible for building an automation solution for the Thermo Scientific Spinnaker robotic arm
    - Built a custom dataset and trained CNN object detectors to help the robotic arm identify specific locations on different Thermo Scientific Instruments
    - This algorithm removes the need for manual calibration of these locations, and automates the entire process for transporting hazardous chemicals from/to various biomedical instruments
