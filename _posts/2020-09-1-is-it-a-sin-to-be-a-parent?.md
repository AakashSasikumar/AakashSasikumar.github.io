description: A thought experiment exploring the origin of sin and what it means to sin.

I am pretty sure that you would be aware of what a good deed or sin is. Committing sins is terrible, and people should strive towards doing good deeds - or that's how the general understanding is. It is very subjective when trying to define sin and good deeds, I won't go into that in this blog. I'll try to explain how becoming a parent might be a sin and what it's implications are.

Global warming is a real threat, and it might very likely be unstoppable. Water and food becoming scarce, natural calamities occurring in higher frequencies, entire regions becoming uninhabitable, are some of the several issues global warming presents. Now, imagine that you are happily married and are wondering whether to have kids. It's quite simple, really, most people tend to choose to have kids. But, choosing to have kids even after being aware of all the threats that global warming poses, is it not a sin?. Is it not a sin to force a human to face all those adversities when you alone control their fate?

This was a puzzle I thought about for quite some time, and I came to a conclusion that, yes, it is a sin to birth a child knowing very well that they might face adversities later on in their life. If you had chosen not to have a kid, you wouldn't have put another human in such a terrible condition. You might have even ended up passing away peacefully before even you faced those issues.

Let us now establish another exciting property of sin.
> You are sinning if you are the reason for another individual to commit sin

`Becoming the reason` for another person to commit a sin is very subjective. I prefer to view it objectively. For example, if you had any part, no matter how insignificant, in being a reason for another person to commit sin, you are sinning.

This statement becomes quite interesting if you look at its ramifications. If your child grows up to become the next Adolf Hitler, you have committed sin because you chose to have the child in the first place. Since you had complete control over whether your child commits sin, you are in effect `the reason` for your child to commit sin. The same goes the other way as well, i.e., if your child grows up to be the next Mother Theresa, you are `the reason` for all the good deeds being done by her.

Let's take this even further. Whatever a child might end up doing, since the parent had complete control over choosing to have a kid or not, the parent becomes responsible for whatever happens. Granted, the parents have no idea what a child might grow up to be. Still, looking at it objectively, it brings forth another intriguing observation.

> Parents are the root cause for all good deeds and sin in the world since they had complete control over what was to happen no matter what the outcome.

If further creation or advancement of good deeds and sin can be controlled by choosing whether or not to procreate; Where did it originate?  Who did it come from? The creation of evil and good can theoretically be traced all the way back to our ancestors. For example, suppose Joseph Stalin's great-great-grandfather had chosen to live his whole life as a celibate. In that case, the deaths of thousands of people would have been avoided as Joseph Stalin wouldn't have ever been born. So, who was responsible for all good and evil? Was it the first pair of homo-sapiens, or was it the apes that we evolved from? It is rather entertaining when thinking about who or what all good and evil can be attributed to. Following the same thought process, one may attribute it to the creation of life, the creation of our planet or even the creation of the entire universe itself.

So what does this all mean? Well, I came to three possible conclusions,

1. Humanity should stop procreating. In effect, putting an end to all sin as well as good deeds.
2. There is no such thing as good or evil. It's merely a figment of our imagination as we have no control over what will happen.
3. I probably have way too much time on my hands and should be doing something more productive and getting on with life

Options 1 and 2 are rather nihilistic, and I don't want them to be true as I am a firm believer of existentialism.  I am choosing to go with conclusion 3 for now.
