This blog post is going to be a long one. I will go over all the aspects of grad school applications starting all the way from exam preparation and end up at the final phase where we submit our applications. Roughly, these are the things I will be going over,

1. Why I chose to pursue a masters
2. Application timeline and plan
3. Exam preparation
4. University Selection
5. Writing the Statement of Purpose
6. Filling out applications
7. Tools to manage and track applications
8. My SOPs and Resume
