# AInstein

A lot of students find it hard to find faculty who have the same research interests as them. Finding information about their department, is kind of tough as university websites tend to be cluttered and aren't that readable (atleast for our university). AInstein is a personal assistant that helps students connect with their university.

You can ask questions to AInstein about faculty, get their contact details, and even ask general questions to AInstein. Using NLP and Artificial Neural Networks, we managed to make AInstein an all purpose assistant. Like Siri and Google Assistant, you it can understand what you are saying with a voice input.

Here are a few examples,

{% include elements/figure.html image="images/projects/ainstein/generalQuestions.png" caption="Faculty Details. Note that there is contextualization as well" width="50%" height="50%"%}

{% include elements/figure.html image="images/projects/ainstein/voiceDemo.png" caption="Replies when asked 'who are you?' and 'Who is Narendra Modi?'" width="50%" height="50%"%}

{% include elements/figure.html image="images/projects/ainstein/universityQuestions.png" caption="General Questions" width="25%" height="25%"%}

{% include elements/button.html link="https://github.com/AakashSasikumar/AInstein" text="View On Github" block=true %}
