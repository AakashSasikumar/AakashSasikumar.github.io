# AnokhaBot

Anokha is our college's tech fest. Every department hosts a variety of events, seminars, games and a lot more things. So much so that, for a new person to get information might take a long time. For Anokha 2018, I worked with the Anokha team to design a chatbot that has all the information that a person would want to know.

Here are a few examples,

{% include elements/figure.html image="images/projects/anokhabot/anokhabot1.png" caption="Specific Details" width="50%" height="50%"%}
{% include elements/figure.html image="images/projects/anokhabot/anokhabot2.png" caption="A Little Bit of Sass" width="50%" height="50%"%}

{% include elements/button.html link="https://github.com/AakashSasikumar/AnokhaBot" text="View On Github" block=true %}
