BlindVision is a project that I worked on during my undergrad. This project used stereo-scopic vision paired with deep neural net based object detection to produce a 3D audio sound that helped a visually impaired person navigate.

The device was built using the following components,

1. 2 Raspberry Pis fixed with a camera
2. A battery pack to power both these devices
3. A pair of earphones for the audio feedback

### A prototype wearable device

The methodology was formalized and was published in Procedia Computer Science. Check out my publications [here]({{site.baseurl}}/publications).
