# **About Me**

<!-- Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br> -->

**GSAK** are the initials of my name, **G**uruvayur **S**asikumar **A**akash **K**rishna.

I am a Masters student at the University of Alberta. My interests are in applications of AI in real world systems. I am currently working under the supervision of [Dr. Omid Ardakanian](http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~oardakan/) on applying Reinforcement Learning for building control.
<!-- I am a 24 year old Computer Science undergrad from Coimbatore, India. I have traveled to a lot of places , done my schooling from 9 schools across the world and what I have procured from it, is my passion for coding. It all started when I got my first laptop at the age of nine and made my first website when I was 11 years old. What inspired me the most at the first place is the potential computer science has. To appease my curiosity, I strive to know how things work; I am determined to innovate in this field. -->
